# FearlessFreedomCharacterSheet
This project contains the code for the Roll20 implementation of the Fearless Freedom character sheet. Fearless Freedom is a cooperative tabletop roleplaying game in development by Kurt Knudsen and Thomas Pohler.

## Installation Guide
This code requires the Roll20 API in order to function properly. At the time of this writing, one must have a Pro subscription on Roll20 in order to use custom character sheets.

In order to install, first navigate to the custom character sheet section of your game settings. Afterwards, copy/paste the contents of charsheet.html into the field labeled "HTML Layout" and the contents of charsheet.css into the field labeled "CSS Styling".

Upon reloading your Roll20 game, these changes will be in effect.
