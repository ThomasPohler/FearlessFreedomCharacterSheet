# FearlessFreedomCharacterSheet
This project contains the code for the Roll20 implementation of the Fearless Freedom character sheet. Fearless Freedom is a cooperative tabletop roleplaying game in development by Kurt Knudsen and Thomas Pohler.

## Installation Guide
This code requires the Roll20 API in order to function properly. In order to install it, one must have a Pro subscription to Roll20 in order to access custom character sheets. Once available, merely copy/paste the code into the custom character sheet field of Roll20.
